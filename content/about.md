> *The core of mans’ spirit comes from new experiences - Into the Wild (2007)*



Hi there. 

I'm Anjjan and I work in the space of cloud computing. I like to solve technical problems that involves design, evolution, analysis and implementation. I am intersted in systems that maintain cloud services. Currently I work in the field of high performance telemetry ingestion and query functionality.

I have a soft corner for LINUX! During my free time I boot up my old laptop with different linux operating systems and try to play around with them. 

This website was based on my experiments with creating new systems and help me improve my writing. I am looking forward to writing about some of my life experiences, ideas, programming and anything that I think is worth putting up in my little corner of Internet. 

I am also an avid Chelsea FC supporter. I follow the club games, participate in Reddit discussions and also sometimes write about the club/football online.

Here's the link to my [GitHub](http://github.com/ajnarayan) profile. 

If you find me and my work interesting and you want to talk to me about it, check out my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/narayananjjan) profile.

If you’d like to connect, feel free to get in touch.
