Recently, I was in a pursuit of trying to identify things that are needed in life. I suddenly realized what Tyler Durden from Fight Club once said - We buy things we don’t need with money we don’t have to impress people we don’t like.

I was wasting my time trying to over-design a fancy website for myself. I was under an impression that when a person visits my website, he should be awestruck looking at some cool graphics on the page and fancy animations. This blog was changed several times because I found something better each time in terms of content, graphics and fancy stuff on the website.

I came to realize that it’s just a website. The notion of a website is to make the readers understand your thoughts in a clear and concise manner. When we want to make things lucid, why waste time trying to make things fancy. Keep it simple, keep it minimal.

My idea of an ideal website:

* Keep it lightweight
* Make it accessible on every device
* Keep it simple so that everyone should be able to access the contents with little effort
* Mainly, get your point across
