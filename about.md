#*The core of mans' spirit comes from new experiences* - *Into the Wild (2007)*


<p>Hi! I'm Anjjan Narayan and welcome to my portfolio webpage. I graduated with a Masters Degree in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology. I am currently a software developer where I spend my time building awesome things to help people connect with their car.</p>

You can Tweet to me at [@ajnarayan93](http://twitter.com/ajnarayan93). Here's the link to my [GitHub](http://github.com/ajnarayan) profile. 

If you find me and my work interesting and you want to talk to me about it, check out my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwkX2UU5CDHRWjUzMnVNd3pIRUE) or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/narayananjjan) profile.

I am an avid Chelsea FC supporter. I follow the club games, participate in [Reddit discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/) and also write about the club on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Anjjan-Narayan). I love LINUX. During my free time I boot up my old laptop with different linux operating systems and try to play around with them. My favorite linux distro is [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) and [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/).

If youâ€™d like to connect, feel free to get in touch or stalk me elsewhere on the web.
