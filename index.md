Hi! I'm Anjjan Narayan and welcome to my portfolio webpage. I'm currently a graduate student in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology.

I am an avid Chelsea FC supporter. I follow the club games, participate in [Reddit discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/) and also write about the club on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Anjjan-Narayan). I love LINUX. During my free time I boot up my old laptop with different linux operating systems and try to play around with them. My favorite linux distro is [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) and [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/).
