My front end development knowledge always revolved around creating HTML, CSS, and JS files and running them on the localhost. Initially my portfolio website was also created in the same way and was hosted on [Github Pages](pages.github.com). Recently (that is today!), I came accross using Jekyll to create blog-aware static site.

You can get the source code for this website over [here](https://github.com/ajnarayan/ajnarayan.github.io). 

The following are the things you need to do: 

1. Create a new repository as `username.github.io`

2. Install Jekyll following the steps mentioned [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/)

3. For the current website, I have used Scribble theme. You can fork it from [here](https://github.com/muan/scribble/fork). 

4. clone the repository onto your computer 

` git clone https://github.com/username/scribble `

5. cd into the folder and run `bundle execute`

6. run `bundle exec jekyll serve`

7. Open your browser and go to localhost:4000 for general testing 

Once complete, push the code onto `username.github.io` repo. You can then check your website by hitting `https://username.github.io`
