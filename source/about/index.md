> *The core of mans' spirit comes from new experiences* - *Into the Wild (2007)*

Hi there. 

I'm Anjjan Narayan and I am passionate about solving problems. I like to code and explore new technologies. I am a ramblin wreck from [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/)!

I am an avid Chelsea FC supporter. I follow the club games, participate in Reddit discussions and also sometimes write about the club/football on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Anjjan-Narayan)

I love LINUX! During my free time I boot up my old laptop with different linux operating systems and try to play around with them. 

This website was based on my experiments with creating new systems and help me improve my writing. I am looking forward to writing about some of my life experiences, ideas, programming and anything that I think is worth putting up in my little corner of Internet. 

You can Tweet to me at [@ajnarayan93](http://twitter.com/ajnarayan93). Here's the link to my [GitHub](http://github.com/ajnarayan) profile. 

If you find me and my work interesting and you want to talk to me about it, check out my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/narayananjjan) profile.

If youâ€™d like to connect, feel free to get in touch or stalk me elsewhere on the web.
