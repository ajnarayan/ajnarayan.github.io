      <description>The less I needed, the better I felt. - Charles Bukowski
  Recently, I was in a pursuit of trying to identify things that are needed in life. I suddenly realized what Tyler Durden from Fight Club once said - We buy things we don’t need with money we don’t have to impress people we don’t like.

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>What is GraphQL As a developer, you will be used to having new technologies and frameworks being released every couple of months. There are three stages after encountering a new technology:
 Stage 1 - Rejection - why should I use it when I already have  Stage 2 - Attraction - Maybe I should check what the buzz is about? Stage 3 - Dedication - Let&amp;rsquo;s go ahead and learn this and see how I can use it in my current scenario  Currently, I feel I am in stage 2 of this 3 stage process.</description>
